First, listen to a reading of the complete poem. Then, read silently and get to know what Shakespeare says about the different stages in the life of man.You may refer to the glossary given at the end of the monologue to help you.

“All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his **time** plays many **parts**, 
His acts being seven **ages**. At first the infant,
**Mewling** and **puking** in the nurse's arms;
Then the **whining** school-boy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, **creeping** like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a **woeful** ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange **oaths**,**and bearded like the **pard**,
**Jealous in honour**,**sudden and quick in quarrel**,
**Seeking the bubble reputation**
**Even in the cannon's mouth**. And then the **justice**,
In fair round belly with good **capon lin'd**,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise **saws** and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the **lean and slipper'd pantaloon**,

With spectacles on nose and **pouch** on side;
His youthful hose, well sav'd, **a world too wide**
For his **shrunk shank**; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish **treble, pipes**
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is **second childishness** and mere **oblivion**;
**Sans** teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.”

William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was a prolific writer during the Elizabethan and Jacobean ages of British theatre (sometimes called the English Renaissance). Shakespeare’s plays are perhaps his most enduring legacy, but they are not the only things he wrote. Shakespeare’s poems remain popular to this day. Shakespeare’s rich and diverse works have spawned countless adaptations across multiple genres and cultures. His writings have been compiled in various iterations of The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, which include all his plays, sonnets, and other poems. William Shakespeare continues to be one of the most important literary figures of the English language.
