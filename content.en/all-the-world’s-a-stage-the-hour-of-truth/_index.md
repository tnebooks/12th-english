# All the World’s a Stage

First, listen to a reading of the complete poem. Then, read silently and get to know what Shakespeare says about the different stages in the life of man.You may refer to the glossary given at the end of the monologue to help you.

“All the world's a stage,\
And all the men and women merely players;\
They have their exits and their entrances;\
And one man in his **time** plays many **parts**, \
His acts being seven **ages**. At first the infant,\
**Mewling** and **puking** in the nurse's arms;\
Then the **whining** school-boy, with his satchel\
And shining morning face, **creeping** like snail\
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,\
Sighing like furnace, with a **woeful** ballad\
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,\
Full of strange **oaths**,**and bearded like the **pard**,\
**Jealous in honour**,**sudden and quick in quarrel**,\
**Seeking the bubble reputation**\
**Even in the cannon's mouth**. And then the **justice**,\
In fair round belly with good **capon lin'd**,\
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,\
Full of wise **saws** and modern instances;\
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts\
Into the **lean and slipper'd pantaloon**,

With spectacles on nose and **pouch** on side;\
His youthful hose, well sav'd, **a world too wide**\
For his **shrunk shank**; and his big manly voice,\
Turning again toward childish **treble, pipes**\
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,\
That ends this strange eventful history,\
Is **second childishness** and mere **oblivion**;\
**Sans** teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.”
