You know, we French **stormed Ratisbon**:
A mile or so away,
On a little **mound**, Napoleon
Stood on our storming-day;
With neck **out-thrust**, you **fancy** how,
Legs wide, arms locked behind,
As if to balance the **prone** brow
**Oppressive** with its mind. 

Just as perhaps he **mused**, ‘My plans
That soar, to earth may fall,
Let once my army-leader **Lannes**
Waver at yonder wall’, –
Out ’twixt the battery-smokes there flew
A rider, bound on bound
Full-galloping: nor **bridle** drew
Until he reached the mound. 

Then off there flung in smiling joy,
And held himself erect
By just his horse’s mane, a boy:
You hardly could suspect –
(So tight he kept his lips **compressed**,
Scarce any blood came through)
You looked twice ere you saw his breast
Was all but shot in two. 

‘Well’, cried he, ‘Emperor, by God’s grace
We’ve got you Ratisbon!
The Marshal’s in the market-place
And you’ll be there **anon**,
To see your **flag-bird** flap his vans
Where I, to heart’s desire,
**Perched** him!’ The Chief ’s eye flashed; his plans
Soared up again like fire. 

The Chief ’s eye flashed; but presently
Softened itself, as **sheathes**
A film the mother-eagle’s eye
When her bruised eaglet breathes:
‘You’re wounded!’ ‘Nay’, his soldier’s pride
Touched to the quick, he said:
‘I’m killed, Sire!’And, his Chief beside,
Smiling, the boy fell dead.

## About The Author

Robert Browning (7 May 1812–12 December 1889) was an English poet and playwright whose mastery of the dramatic monologue made him one of the foremost, Victorian poets. He was born in Camberwell, a suburb of London on 7 May 1812. He was educated mainly at home, but he attended a short course in Greek at London University. His poems are known for their irony, characterisation, dark humour, social commentary, historical settings and challenging vocabulary and syntax. He developed a unique form of conversational, unrhythmic verse. The collection ‘Dramatis Personae’ and the book-length epic poem “The Ring and the Book” made him a leading British poet. By 1881 in recognition of his outstanding contribution to literature, a literary society called Browning Society was established.
