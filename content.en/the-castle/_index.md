# The Castle

All through that summer at ease we lay,\
And daily from the **turret** wall\
We watched the **mowers** in the hay\
And the enemy half a mile away\
They seemed no threat to us at all.

For what, we thought, had we to fear\
With our arms and **provender**, load on load,\
Our **towering battlements**, **tier** on tier,\
And friendly allies drawing near\
On every leafy summer road.

Our gates were strong, our walls were thick,\
So smooth and high, no man could win\
A **foothold** there, no clever trick\
Could take us dead or **quick**,\
Only a bird could have got in.

What could they offer us for **bait**?\
Our captain was brave and we were true…\
There was a little private gate,\
A little **wicked wicket gate**.\
The **wizened warder** let them through.

Oh then our **maze** of tunneled stone\
Grew thin and **treacherous** as air.\
The cause was lost without a **groan**,\
The famous **citadel overthrown**,\
And all its secret galleries bare.

How can this shameful tale be told?\
I will **maintain** until my death\
We could do nothing, being sold:\
Our only enemy was gold,\
And we had no arms to fight it with.
