# The Castle

All through that summer at ease we lay,\
And daily from the **turret** wall\
We watched the **mowers** in the hay\
And the enemy half a mile away\
They seemed no threat to us at all.

For what, we thought, had we to fear\
With our arms and **provender**, load on load,\
Our **towering battlements**, **tier** on tier,\
And friendly allies drawing near\
On every leafy summer road.

Our gates were strong, our walls were thick,\
So smooth and high, no man could win\
A **foothold** there, no clever trick\
Could take us dead or **quick**,\
Only a bird could have got in.

What could they offer us for **bait**?\
Our captain was brave and we were true…\
There was a little private gate,\
A little **wicked wicket gate**.\
The **wizened warder** let them through.

Oh then our **maze** of tunneled stone\
Grew thin and **treacherous** as air.\
The cause was lost without a **groan**,\
The famous **citadel overthrown**,\
And all its secret galleries bare.

How can this shameful tale be told?\
I will **maintain** until my death\
We could do nothing, being sold:\
Our only enemy was gold,\
And we had no arms to fight it with.

## About The Author

Edwin Muir (1887-1959) was a renowned Scottish poet, novelist, translator and critic. He was remembered for his vivid poetry. He began writing poetry at a relatively old age, and over the course of several years worked out an individual, philosophical style for which he gained recognition later in his life. First Poems and Chorus of the Newly Dead contain Muir’s initial attempts. Muir’s later collections include Variations on a Time Theme, The Narrow Place, The Voyage and Other Poems, The Labyrinth, and One Foot in Eden.
